/**
 * 
 * FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * 
 * 0. Functions are a block of code we can reuse. Functions help to optimize our code and write less repeating code.
 * 
 * 1. There are two phases to using Functions. First we DEFINE the function.
 *      a. We define a function with a keyword followed by () which may include parameters
 *      b. Next, we write {} which enclose the code to be executed.
 *          ex: function myFunction () {
 *                  }
 * 2. After defining the function, we CALL the function with the code inside the {}. When the function hits RETURN it will stop executing.
 * 
 * 3.
